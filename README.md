# Multitarget-peptide-inhibitors-using-LSTM-biLSTM-model
In this work, we are employing LSTM/biLSTM deep learning method to generate potential peptides for targeting sandfly-borne Leishmania and CHPV. In this study, a positive dataset was developed by considering APD3, DRAVP, CAMP, dbAMP, DBAASPS databases, and negative datasets were extracted from HORDB and UniProt.
